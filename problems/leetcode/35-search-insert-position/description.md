# 35. Search Insert Position

Source: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

Indices are zero-based. An insertion position can range from `0` (before the
first element) to `nums.length` (after the last element). Return the position;
you do not need to insert the target or return a modified array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `nums` contains **distinct** values sorted in **ascending** order.
- `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`
